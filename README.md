# 8-2-Journal-Portfolio-Submission

# 1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.
The Gaming Room asked for a redesign of their game, "Draw It or Lose It," to make it work on multiple platforms. The goal was to ensure unique names for games, teams, and players while keeping a single instance of the game service.

# 2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I organized the requirements and constraints clearly. The system architecture was explained well, making it easy to understand the design’s scalability and efficiency.

# 3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
While this project focused only on design, creating the document helped me identify key parts and dependencies. This made planning easier and helped avoid issues later.

# 4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve the section on system interactions. Adding flowcharts or simple diagrams would make it clearer how the parts of the system work together.

# 5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I used the requirements to understand what the client needed. For example, I made sure the system supports scalability and unique identifiers. Considering user needs is important to make a product that works well and provides value.

# 6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I divided the design into smaller tasks and worked step by step. I also used client feedback to improve the design. In the future, I want to use prototypes and get feedback earlier to make sure the design meets expectations.
